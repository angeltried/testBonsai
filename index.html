                    <h1>Gelato is a slightly indica dominant hybrid (55% indica/45% sativa) strain created through a cross of the infamous Sunset Sherbet X Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies strains. This dank bud is infamous for its insanely delicious flavor and hugely powerful effects that are fueled by a THC level that hits its low point at 20% on average. Gelato has a flavor that's said to be much like a sweet sherbet, with fruity blueberry and orange flavors. The aroma is just as sickly sweet, with a lavender citrus berry bouquet that has a woody effect as the nugs are broken apart and smoked. Although it has a tasty flavor, Gelato is definitely best loved for its effects. Even with its slight indica dominance, the high is head heavy in nature and won't leave you sedated or couch-locked. It starts with a cerebral head rush that hits you in the forehead with an uplifted euphoria and a sense of slightly focused energy.  </h1>
